![preview](preview.png)

**Deadline: May 16th (Thu) at 15:00pm**

----

## Before Doing Assignment

If you have not done the [task01](../task01), [task02](../task02) do it first to set up the C++ development environment.

Follow [this document](../doc/submit.md) to submit the assignment, In a nutshell, before doing the assignment,  
- make sure you synchronized the `main ` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task04` from `main` branch.
- make sure you are currently in the `task04` branch (use `git branch -a` command).

Additionally, you need to install `glfw` library. 
Follow [this document](../doc/setup_glfw.md) to install glfw.

Now you are ready to go!

## Problem 1

1. Build the code using cmake
2. Run the code
3. Take a screenshot image (looks like image at the top)
4. Save the screenshot image overwriting `task04/problem1.png`

## Problem 2

Write some code (about 5 ~ 10  lines) around `line #29` in `shader.vert` 
to define the coordinate transformation for mirror reflection.
Read the instruction in the `shader.vert` for more information.

Save the screenshot image overwriting `task04/problem2.png`

## After Doing the Assignment

After modify the code, push the code and submit a pull request.
